## Key Sentences.

1. We have mainly focused on deep learning models based on Transformers. However, Elasticsearch has often served us as a great baseline. 


## Step

1. Understsand what is the ElasticSearch , and what is the search engine.

- Databases are great for fast and frequent inserts, updates, or deletes, unlike Data Warehouses or Elasticsearch.

- Probably even faster if you create a database index on this field. Then it is saved on a disk in a sorted manner, which speeds up the lookup process significantly. But what if you wanted to find all books containing a certain text fragment? In a database, we would probably look at SQL LIKE statements, possibly with some wildcards %.

- cons (disadvantage)

1) What if you want to order the rows by how __closely the text relates to what you queried for?__
2) What if you have multiple fields e.g. title and text, that you would like to include in your search?
3) What if you don’t want to search for the entire phrase but divide the query into separate words and accept hits containing only some of them?
4) What if you want to reject the commonly occurring words in the language and consider only the relevant parts of your query?

- Elasticsearch manages to deal with matching queries and documents’ texts through a multitude of various query types that we’ll expand further on. However, its most important feature is __an inverted index, created on terms coming from tokenized and preprocessed original texts.__
--> map them as a set/vector


2. Understand when not to use Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is not a database but a search engine and should be treated as such. Meaning, don’t treat it as the only data storage you have. 

3. Understand the scoring mechanism

BM25 is the default scoring/relevance algorithm in Elasticsearch, a successor to TF-IDF. 

ex) Elastic Search is a cool search engine desgined for fast querying -> Elastic search engine querying.

If we tokenized the sentence, we would expect words like Elasticsearch, search, engine, querying to be more valuable than is, a, cool, designed, for, fast, as the latter ones contribute less to the essence of this sentence.

4. Understand the mechanism of text pre-processing

factor 1. Analyzers

* We can use built-in Analyzers provided by Elastic or define our own. In order to create a custom one, we should determine which tokenizer we’d like to use and provide a set of filters.

an analyzer is both a Tokenizer, which divides the text into tokens (terms), and a collection of Filters, which do additional processing.

factor 2. Filters

Filters not only perform token selection but are also responsible for a multitude of common NLP preprocessing tasks. They can also be used for a number of operations such as:

- stemming,
- stopwords filtering,
- lower/upper casing,
- n-grams creation on chars or words.

factor 3. Tokenizers

5. Understand different types of queries

* The basic distinction we can make is whether we care about the relevance score or not. Having this considered, we have got two contexts to choose from:

** query context — calculates the score, whether the document matches a query, and how good is the match,
** filter context — does not calculate the score, it only identifies the documents that match the query or not.

--> use a query context to tell how closely documents match the query and a filter context to filter out unmatched documents that will not be considered when calculating the score.

1) Bool query
 we would often like to use logical expressions like AND, OR, NOR. They are available in Elasticsearch DSL (domain-specific language) as must, should, and must_not, respectively. Using them we can easily describe the required logical relationships.

2) Full-text queries

Match Query
; this is a standard for full-text searches, where each query is analyzed the same way as the field it is matched against

keyword ; Fuzziness
keysentence ;  It defines the accepted error rate for each word, which is interpreted as Levenstein edit distance. 

Match phrase query
; it’s a variation of match query where all terms must appear in the queried field, in the same order, next to each other.

Match prefix query
; it converts the last term in the query into a prefix term, which acts as a term followed by a wildcard.

Combined fields query
; allows for searching through multiple fields as if they were combined into a single one.

Multi match query
; querying multiple fields that have different analyzers applied or even of a different type.
